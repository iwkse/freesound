Using the add-on is straightforward and intuitive.
All you have to do is search for some sounds and click on the Search button. You got further options for searching, HQ (High Quality Preview) allows you to download the best available preview at cost of download speed and disk space. 
The "from" "to" range allows you to search sounds with a specific length. You can for example search a sound which is at least 2 seconds and max 5 seconds if you set 2 and 5 in the fields.
The next box allows you to sort sounds based on rating.
Last box allows you to filter by license.

The page navigation buttons allow you respectively to jump to the first and last page, increment by 10 or 1 or add an arbitrary number in the page field.
